## Bad News Bots FTCRobotController
This repo currently contains an FTCRobotController build with our code from the **Ultimate Goal 2020-2021 Season** as well as, hopefully, our 2021-2022 code. For organizational purposes, we may move the old stuff to a different project.

## What's happening right now.
-Currently (this summer), I (Frank) am working on robot Odometry and general autonomy. 
-Devin and I have been prototyping an intake system.

## Big things TO DO for next season!
-Learn CAD (Fusion 360). Being able to develop effective designs digitally before building them would speed up our overall workflow and allow us to get much more done in the same amount of time. If we want to advance bveyond state level competitions, we will have come up with innovative designs in a timely manner. Using CAD, it is possible to make complex, effective designs much quicker than through experimentation and putting random parts together. The ideal CAD workflow would allow for us to import models of individual pieces we have in the lab and design a full prototype, which we can then build, knowing exactly what parts we need AND that it will fit together properly.
